    <h1><strong>I'm Looking For Durand Durand!</strong></h1>
    
    <h2>What can we say about Barbarella, Queen of the Galaxy? Well ... </h2>
    <div class="barb1">
     <p id="first"><strong>"BARBARELLA is a beautiful girl with long hair, golden skin and a strange sweet name.
    Clothes cramp her style. But somehow she 
    remains mysterious. Fragile. Yet invincible. 
    Above all, BARBARELLA maintains a 
    sense of innocence. She is a wild creature, 
    realistic, crafty, emancipated.</strong></p></div>

 <div class="barb2">  
<p id="second"><strong> BARBARELLA is a champion Earth astronaut. 
    She lives in a future century. She 
    handles herself like a female James Bond, 
    vanquishing evil in all forms and rewarding
    - in her own loving way - the men who
    befriend her in outer space. 
    Whether she is wrestling with Black Guards
    - hollow leather robots - the evil queen of
    the perverted City of Sogo, or restoring
    the lost morale of her fine feathered angel 
    friend, Pygar, BARBARELLA is in 
    command of the situation. Even though, more often than not, she is underessed for action. 
    Uninhibited ... Irresistible ... Female ... 
    BARBARELLA is love. Love. All love ... "</strong>

    - From the Barbarella 1968 British Press Book </p></div>
